# Hangman

## Project Description

### Project Aim
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### What does the program do?
This program uses functions to:
(1) check user input (validating the user entered response)
(2) matches the validated entered input with the random generated word (within a pre-defined list). 
If the user does not guess correctly, then the program continues to ask for input, and once a correct guess is made the program terminates. 

Prompts are displayed to the user to highlight whether their guess was incorrect, or whether their input is invalid.
