# Hangman

## Project Aim
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## What the program does
This program uses functions to (1) check user input (validating the user entered response) and (2) matches the validated entered input with the random generated word (within a pre-defined list). 
If the user does not make guess correctly, then the program continues to ask for input, and once a correct guess is made the program terminates. 
Prompts are displayed to the user to highlight whether their guess was incorrect, or whether their input is invalid.
